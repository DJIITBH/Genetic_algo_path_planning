# Path Planning using Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a genetic algorithm for optimal path planning. It evolves a population of candidate solutions (chromosomes) to find an efficient, collision-free path between a start and goal point.

## Features

- Binary chromosome representation
- Crossover and mutation operations
- Fitness evaluation with path length, proximity, and turning penalties
- Supports obstacle checking (optional)

## Documentation
Inspired from Mr TolunayMengi
